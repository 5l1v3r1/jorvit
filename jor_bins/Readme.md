# JÃ¶rmungandr node binaries

Place the node binaries for your architecture.

- `jormungandr`
- `jcli`

The files can be retrieved from [https://github.com/input-output-hk/jormungandr/releases/tag/nightly](https://github.com/input-output-hk/jormungandr/releases/tag/nightly).

Right now please use only [nightly](https://github.com/input-output-hk/jormungandr/releases/tag/nightly) versions.

> **Note**: If you have the binaries already installed and available on your system path, if you wand to use those binaries, there is no need to copy those binaries here. The service will check first this folder and if no binaries found inside the folder it will try to use systemwide binaries if available.
